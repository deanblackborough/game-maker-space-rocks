# Space Rocks

This is a slightly modified version of the Space Rocks demo project for Game Maker Studio. I'm playing around with Game Maker to help my son get started.

## Changes
- Added the powerup, menu and music mods
- Replaced all the assets with assets from Kenny.nl
- Multiple asteroid types
- Dynamic scoring, go faster, score more
- Tigher collision detection, in the demo the smaller asteriods are the large asteroid with a smaller sprite and the BB doesn't rotate.
- General gameplay tweaks
- More changes incoming.
